# BiMo
This is the replication package for our work submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, i.e., Weifeng Pan, Xiaolong Cui, Hua Ming, Zijiang Yang, Jingshu Chen, Stephen W. Turner, and Bo Jiang. XXXXXXXXX. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 2025. [[PDF](#)]

# CANs
This directory contains the CANs that we built for all the subject systems used in our experiments. There are three versions of CANs according to different weighting mechanisms. 

# MCCNs
This directory will contain the MCCNs used in this work. But now it is null. The whole set of MCCNs will be available after our work's acceptance. Of course, interested readers can email us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn) to get the whole data set in advance. Please use your institutional email address. Otherwise, we may not be able to respond to your emails.

# goldset
This directory contains the actual key classes for each subject system.

# RQs
This directory contains the experimental results obtained for each RQ.

# discussion
This directory contains the experimental results obtained in the Discussion section.

# Appdendix
This directory contains the online appendices mentioned in our manuscript.

# otherResults
This directory contains other results not reported in our manuscript, such as *precision* and *f$_1$*.

# Code
This directory contains the software BiMo.jar to calculate BMR values of classes. It is a small part of our own developed software, SNAP, which can be obtained by emailing us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn). Please use your institutional email address. Otherwise, we may not be able to respond to your emails.

# How to use our dataset and software
The steps to use BiMoV1.0.jar is shown as follows. To run the software, you should install the jdk (java development kit) 1.6 (or higher) first in your computer. JDK can be downloaded from https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
- Download the BiMoV1.0.jar and the dataset file to the same directory.
- Double-click the BiMoV1.0.jar
- Select File->Open a CAN file... 
- Browse the data directory and select a specific CAN file (ending with .net).
- Select Analysis -> BiCoRank
- Then you will get the BMR values for each class in the popup window.
